# Predicting_World-s_Best_FootballXI
This time  have tried to predict the best lineup on the basis of their ratings using pandas and numpy.

Here I have used a dataset of football players with their ratings of club and nation along with their positions at which they play for both 
club and nation.

Using the ratings of players for various attributes like speed, stamina, agility, power etc. I have calculated their scores and the player
with best score is selected for a particular position according to the formation which I have decided.

I have also visualized the outputs using seaborn. For the calculation purposes I have used numpy.

The final Best FIFA Football XI looked something like this.
